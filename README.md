# RealMute: A PocketMine chat management plugin by Leo3418
RealMute is a plugin that allows adminstrator to mute players in chat. 

## Upgrading from version 1.x?
Because of changes of internal mechanisms of muting players, the **config.yml** will be automatically updated to v2.x format.

## Features
* Mute and unmute individual players in chat
* Keep muting players even if they quit and join server again
* Mute all players in chat
* See list of muted players and status of the plugin
* An optional function to notify muted players when they are sending messages
* An optional function to keep allowing OPs sending messages while all players are muted
* An optional function to block players' private messages alongside chat messages
* Block and mute players if they send any prohibited contents set by adminstrator

## Usage
* `/rmute <player>` Mute a player
* `/runmute <player>` Unmute a player
* `/muteall` Mute all players
* `/unmuteall` Unmute all players
* `/realmute help <page>` View help
* `/realmute notify` Toggle notification to muted players

Note on muting/unmuting players: Player name is not case-sensitive.
